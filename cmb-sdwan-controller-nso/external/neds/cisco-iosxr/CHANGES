cisco-iosxr v6.4 [2018-02-08]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

  WARNING:
    When using cisco-iosxr with other NEDs, certain combinations of NED versions
    may cause 'random' Exceptions. The reason for this is the introduction of
    a new common NED component - nedcom.jar - which initially was located in
    shared-jar, but later moved to private-jar. However, since the JAVA loader
    looks in shared-jar directories first, a newer NED with nedcom.jar in
    private-jar will still load another NED's older nedcom.jar in shared-jar;
    causing a version conflict and quite possibly an Exception.

    Hence, if you are using a newer NED (with private-jar/nedcom.jar) you must
    make sure no other NEDs in your project has a shared-jar/nedcom.jar. If they
    do, you must upgrade them to a version which also has nedcom in private-jar.

    The following NED versions have their nedcom.jar in shared-jar:

    a10-acos      3.6.5
    alu-sr        6.0.2 to 6.1.1
    cisco-asa     5.2 to to 5.2.1
    cisco-ios     5.2.8 to 5.4.2
    cisco-iosxr   6.0 to 6.1
    cisco-nx      4.4.7 to 4.5.2
    huawei-vrp    4.2.6

    In short, avoid the above NED versions when using other NEDs.

  WARNING:
    Avoid using NSO-4.4.1 to NSO-4.4.1.3 due to a serious bug causing 'end-set'
    to be lost when reading data from the device. This in turn will cause the
    following config to be lost. Below sets use 'end-set':
      extcommunity-set rt *
      extcommunity-set soo *
      rd-set *
      prefix-set *
      as-path-set *
      community-set *
    The fix is identified in NSO CHANGES by:
      (Issue tracker: #28080, #28583, #29220)

    (IOSXR-317 / RT29468)

  - Added ned-setting 'extended-parser robust-mode', useful to avoid having

Corrections:


cisco-iosxr v6.0 [June 02, 2017]
================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added new feature for optimizing sync-from (and compare-config).
    Enable with ned-setting 'cisco-iosxr extended-parser turbo-mode'.
    (IOSXR-286)

  - Implemented SFTP support for transfering configuration before commit.
    May be preferred for large configuration diffsets.
    Configure minimum config line(s) threshold to enable. For example, enable SFTP
    apply for all config diffsets longer than 100 lines:
     devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-iosxr apply-device-config-settings
       sftp-threshold 100
     devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-iosxr apply-device-config-settings
       file "disk0a:/usr/commit-config.tmp"
    (IOSXR-282)

  - Support for the new NSO API call showPartial. The NSO will call this function
    when a configuration change has been committed with the 'no-overwrite' flag.
    This means that NSO will only verify that the config involved in the commit
    has not been changed out of band.
    The NED will in the showPartial function try to only dump the parts of the
    device config that is relevant for the commit (in a best effort approach).
    Currently only NSO 4.4 supports the showPartial API.
    (IOSXR-277)

  - SFTP support for fetching the device configuration.
    May be preferred for systems with a large running-config.
    Configure ned-settings to enable, for example:
     devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-iosxr get-device-config-settings
       method sftp-transfer
     devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-iosxr get-device-config-settings
       file "disk0a:/usr/running-config.tmp"
    (IOSXR-276)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router bgp * / neighbor * / graceful-maintenance
    (IOSXR-283 / RT28500)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router isis * / max-link-metric
    (IOSXR-281 / RT28476)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router msdp / vrf * / description
     router msdp / vrf * / mesh-group
     router msdp / vrf * / sa-filter * in|out
    (IOSXR-279 / RT28458)

  - Moved caching of encrypted secrets from applyConfig/commit to persist,
     thereby enabling support for device encrypted cipher in:
     admin / username * / secret
     admin / username * / password

  - Optimized sync-from configuration transformation code.

Corrections:

  - Read device-profile from devices device <devname> device-profile.
    Default to cisco-iosxr.
    (IOSXR-278)

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

     result
     > default interface Loopback1
     RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:259-ip-vrf-5(config)#
    (IOSXR-268)

  - Support for running multiple commands in 'live-status exec any' and config

     for each command, e.g.:
       exec "command 1 | prompts Y ; command 2 | prompts N"
     Warning: No error checking is done on command output, i.e. this command
              is 100% raw, you must check the errors yourself. Only exception
              (of course) is that config command may not leave config mode.

    (IOSXR-252 / RT27793)


cisco-iosxr v5.2 [April 7, 2017]
================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Removed tailf:cli-no-keyword annotation on sub leaves
     in policy-map * / class * / due to problem deleting.
    (IOSXR-245 / RT27720)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router bgp * / session-group * / shutdown
    (IOSXR-244 / RT27716)

  - Support for device encrypted cipher in:
     router bgp * / vrf * / neighbor * / password
    (IOSXR-243 / RT27679)

  - API CHANGE:
    Support for device encrypted cipher in:
     ftp client password
     ntp / authentication-key * md5
     router bgp * / session-group * / password
     router ospf * / message-digest-key
     router ospf * / area * / message-digest-key
    Due to this added support, the YANG in above config has changed and
     XML templates must be updated to match the new YANG.

  - Added an internal live-status command to force a resync of all cached
     encrypted values used by NedSecrets. Useful to solve an issue where the
     device rehashes type 7 secrets with a different seed, causing the values
     to diff from the old ones, even using the same cleartext password.
     Issue like this:
      admin@ncs# devices device <devname> live-status exec any "secrets resync"
     Note: the command will do a "show running-config" from the device, hence
           may be quote slow for large configs.

  - Added an internal live-status command to delete all cached encrypted values
     in NedSecrets.

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE
     router ospf * / max-metric router-lsa
    Complete redesign due to bad modeling. Now also supports no arguments.
    (IOSXR-248 / RT27736)

  - API CHANGE:
     aaa authentication login *
     aaa authentication subscriber *
     aaa authorization commands *
     aaa authorization exec *
     aaa authorization eventmanager *
     aaa authorization subscriber *
    Due to lack of support for user sorted method list.
    Removed 'ordered-by user' from aaa authentication login *
    (IOSXR-241 / RT27595)

  - Strip meta-data prefix in NedSecrets if shown, to avoid bad regexp.

     flow exporter-map * / version v9 / options sampler-table timeout
     flow exporter-map * / version v9 / template data timeout
     flow exporter-map * / version v9 / template options timeout
    (IOSXR-78 / RT24496)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / backup-bw unlimited
    (IOSXR-77 / RT24489)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:

    uses 2-arg version of attach() which avoids problem in NCS prior to 4.1.
   (IOSXR-55 / RT23735)


cisco-iosxr v4.3.7 [August 19, 2016]
====================================

General:

     router bgp * / neighbor * / address-family * / multipath
    (IOSXR-76 / RT24383)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     multicast-routing / address-family ipv4 / mdt data a.b.c.d threshold|acl-name

  - Support for a/b/c/d/e naming in Ethernet interfaces.
   (IOSXR-64 / RT24015)

  - API CHANGE:
    Removed version leaf (not config). Replaced with below:
    Added info from output of 'show version in cached-show container in
    tailf-ned-cisco-iosxr module for fast access in service code. Info is
    updated upon connect, i.e. may change if output of show version changes.
    Default enabled. Disable by setting:
     ned-settings cisco-iosxr-cached-show-enable version false
    Example output:
     admin@ncs# show running-config devices device asr9k-1 config cached-show
     devices device asr9k-1
      config
       cached-show version version 5.1.2
       cached-show version model ASR9K
    Note: Even though this info is in config, obviously it is not config
          and can not be set on the device. Trying to set it will only
          change the value in NCS, not on device.
    (IOSXR-71 / RT24287)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE: Added support for nsr disable, changing leaf nsr
     to a presence container.
   (IOSXR-64 / RT24015)

  - Added cli-multi-word-key to route-policy name
   (IOSXR-64 / RT24015)

  - Do not (re-)quote '# description entries' in route-policy.
   (IOSXR-64 / RT24015)

    (RT23616)

  - NED sends remove command 'no metadata <name>' before modifying /service-function-chaining/metadata'
    (editing medatadata is not allowed. So, NED deletes it fi<rst and re-created it.)
    (IOSXR-58 / RT23794)

Corrections:

  - YANG bug fixes:
     Added missing compact-syntax in: router isis * / lsp-gen-interval

    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added cisco-iosxr-show-running-strict-mode ned-setting in order to be able

     mpls traffic-eng / gmpls optical-uni
   (RT23399)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
    extcommunity-set rt, rd-set, prefix-set, as-path-set and community-set must
    (or rather need) no longer contain a comma ',' in the end of each entry.
    Reason being support has been implemented for modifying existing sets by
    resending all entries after modification.
    (RT23158

  - If answer (sent by prompts) is only one character, don't send NL (newline).

  - Fixed error handling bug which caused the invalid line to not be reported.
    Instead a EOF was reported because the NED sent too many exit commands to
    the device.
    (RT23358)

  - NCS/NSO workaround:
    Trim quotes erronously inserted by service node in live-status exec cmd.
    (RT23355)

  - Default to cisco-iosxr-transaction-id-method commit-list. Change to
    config-hash for previous default method (note: much slower).

  - Added 'any' exec command under live-status to be able to execute any IOS
    command on the device. For example:
    admin@ncs# devices device asr9k live-status exec any "show ppp summary"
    (IOSXR-45)

  - Added support for passing answers to prompts in live-status exec commands.
    Append '| prompts <answer1> [answer2]' to command.
    Note: For hitting enter only on a prompt, add the prompt key 'ENTER'
    Examples:
     devices device asr9k live-status exec any "reload | prompts yes"

    Also implemented a ned-setting - cisco-iosxr-auto-prompts - which can be
    used to register standard answers to standard questions. For example:
    devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-iosxr-auto-prompts Q1 question
      "Proceed with reload" answer "yes"
    See README file for more info.

Corrections:

  - Split class-map * / match dscp lines into multiple lines of maximum eight

Changes that might affect a package upgrade from release 4.0.1:
    interface * / ipv6 address
    interface * / ipv6 nd prefix
    router static / address-family ipv6 unicast / *
    router static / vrf * / address-family ipv6 unicast / *
    control-plane / management-plane / ? / interface * / allow address ipv6 *
    ethernet cfm / domain * / service * / continuity-check interval
    All 'uses bgp-address-family-ipv6-grouping'

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
    l2vpn / xconnect group * / mp2mp * / auto-discovery bgp / route-target *
    l2vpn / xconnect group * / mp2mp * / auto-discovery bgp / signaling-protocol
    l2vpn / xconnect group * / mp2mp * / control-word

    l2vpn / xconnect group * / mp2mp * / mtu
    l2vpn / xconnect group * / mp2mp * / vpn-id

    l2vpn / bridge group * / bridge-domain * / flooding
    logging host * port
    ipv6 conflict-policy
    ipv6 prefix-list *

cisco-iosxr v4.0.1 [Nov 25, 2015]
=================================

Enhancements:

 - Expanded YANG model in:
    ipsla

 - Additions to the YANG model:
    dhcp ipv4 / profile * / giaddr policy
    ethernet cfm / domain * / service * down-meps
    ethernet cfm / domain * / service * / mep crosscheck
    forward-protocol udp *
    ftp client password
    ftp client username
    multicast-routing / address-family ipv4 / mdt source
    performance-mgmt statistics
    router bgp * / address-family ipv4 multicast
    router ospf * / redistribute connected
    router-convergence / collect-diagnostics *
    rpl editor
    (RT20884)

  - The NED is now configurable regarding the max number of command lines it
    shall send in a chunk to the device. Default is 100.
    A higher number usually gives better performance but can also
    have negative impact on the NEDs error detection ability. If an error
    occurs in the middle of the 'chunk' the execution will continue with the
    remaining lines. This can result in that for instance a config leaf is
    accidentally set.

    Note, the cisco-iosxr NED was previously hard coded to send chunks of
    1000 commands at a time.

    To set to one command per chunk, do as follows in the NCS/NSO CLI:
    $ devices device <name> ned-settings cisco-iosxr-number-of-lines-to-send-in-chunk 1
    $ commit

      (Issue tracker #16500)

This NED does require NCS version 3.0.1 or later.


cisco-iosxr v3.0 [March 4, 2014]
================================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.7.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

Non-backwards compatible corrections:

  - This NED was formerly named "cisco-ios-xr". It has now been renamed to
    "cisco-iosxr" according to the new naming convention.
    When replacing older cisco-ios-xr NED with this version the old directory
    needs to be removed. Existing CDB data is not affected by this change.


=====================================================================
The Tail-f package: cisco-iosxr NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
